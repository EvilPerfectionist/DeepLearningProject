# DeepLearningProject: Animation Colorization with Memory-Augmented Networks

## Overview

The project is to reproduce the Memory-Augmented Networks proposed by [Coloring With Limited Data: Few-shot Colorization via Memory Augmented Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11888).

## Requirement

* python-opencv
* matplotlib

## Outline

* How to generate dataset

## How to generate dataset

The file `dataset_generator.py` can be used to extract image frames from videos.
